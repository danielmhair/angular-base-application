Setting up computer for Programming Session 1
=============================================

We will assume you went through all the necessary videos from `Udemy`'s Course about Web Developement from the teacher `Rob Percival`. The necessary videos are as follows:
- Section 1: HTML
- Section 2: CSS
- Section 3: Javascript

NOTE: You can still go through these steps if you haven't finished those tutorials. Just be sure to have those finished by Saturday (if you can).

## Overview:
Throughout this process, some of these words will not be familiar to you. Ignore that. Just know that they are needed to setup your computer to use `Typescript` and `Angular`. As we go through the session and in the future, these things will make more sense.

### Step 1 - Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
`NodeJS` provides us with a `NodeJS` Click on the link "NodeJS" above. Select the operating system and then run the installer it downloads.

### Step 2 - Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
Make sure to install `Yarn` after you install `NodeJS`. Click on the link and there is a button on the screen that says "Download Installer". Download it and install Yarn that way.

### Step 3 - Install Typescript
To install Typescript, you will use `npm`. This is why you installed `NodeJS`. When you installed `NodeJS`, it automatically installed `npm`. `NPM` stands for `Node Package Manager`. This helps you install libraries into your application. Think of `npm` as a Home Depot for your app. You go to Home Depot to buy a tool. That tool allows you to do more with your project. `npm` has hundreds of "tools" that you can use, which allow you to do more with your app.

In our case, we will use `npm` to install `Typescript`. Here is how you do it:

#### Step 3a - Open command line
To open the command line, either search for "Command Prompt" in Windows (or press CTRL+R => Type in "cmd.exe" => Press Enter). For MAC, search for "Terminal"

### Step 4 - Install Angular's CLI
The image below is from [Angular Cli's Guide](https://cli.angular.io). Run those commands in Window's Command Prompt or Mac's Terminal.

This will also verify the code.

### Step 6 - Copy code in this repo
