angular-base-application
========================
This application is a base application for all other applications. This way we can simply clone this repo and start from there when a new app is made. This will have Angular built in with Angular Material (for ease of use), and fonts installed (font awesome &amp; material icons).

This will also be an overview of all your learning, so you can always refer back to it.
