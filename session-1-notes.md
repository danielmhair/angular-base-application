Session 1 Notes
================

Keep in mind that we will not get through all lists in `Programming and the real world`. But as we decide which app we will build, we will take one of the pieces of the app (a section of it), and then teach you all these principles as we build it. It doesn't matter how far we get. The next session we have will continue from that point. But we will do these through projects to build an app. This is why we will cover how to use Chrome's console, debugging, and which app we want to focus on first.

## Overview
- Learning through Chrome's console
  1. Open Google Chrome
  2. Press CTRL+SHIFT+I or right click anywhere on the page and click "Inspect Element"
  3. Click on the "Console" tab
- Debugging in Chrome or VS Code
  1. Install Chrome extension for VS Code
  2. Go to source => CTRL+P => type in file name => Create a debug spot
  3. Press `F5` or click "Debug" => "Start Debugging"
- Building your first application
  - Decide which one (application that will cover most of these concepts)
  - Separate app into multiple pieces/components.
  - Describe next steps to learn
- Understanding of current knowledge
- Programming and the real world
  - Variable - Box with a label
  - Conditions
    - if, else if, else
      - shorthand if-else - Tertiary operators
    - not (!), and (&&), or (||)
      - Combining conditions
  - Repeaters
    - for loop - walking
    - while loop - while the time is before 5pm, keep working
    - do while loop
    - Recursion
  - Class - describe an object
  - Interface - plug and interface. Input plug, output 120v.
  - Data Structures
    - Primitives
      - number - 0, 5, -5, 0.4, 9.9, 20.4, -90.4, etc
      - string - a list of characters like "Jimboby!@!$!%*%"
      - boolean - true or false
    - Array
      - a list (of strings, numbers)
    - Tree
    - Map
      - key/value pair - a key "maps" to a value
      - Buckets with labels and the buckets can have anything in them
    - Object
      - Just like a class, but its an "instance"
        - Classes are like a structure - So you make a Dog class, but that isn't a real dog, it just describes the dog. The object is an actual dog. It has a real name, a real type, etc.
