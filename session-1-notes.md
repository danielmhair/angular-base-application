## Overview
- Understanding of current knowledge
- Programming and the real world
  - Variable - Box with a label
  - Conditions
    - if, else if, else
      - shorthand if-else - Tertiary operators
    - not (!), and (&&), or (||)
      - Combining conditions

  - Data Structures
    - Primitives
      - number - 0, 5, -5, 0.4, 9.9, 20.4, -90.4, etc
      - string - a list of characters like "Jimboby!@!$!%*%"
      - boolean - true or false
    - Array
      - a list (of strings, numbers)
    - Tree
    - Map
      - key/value pair - a key "maps" to a value
      - Buckets with labels and the buckets can have anything in them
    - Object
      - Just like a class, but its an "instance"
        - Classes are like a structure - So you make a Dog class, but that isn't a real dog, it just describes the dog. The object is an actual dog. It has a real name, a real type, etc.
