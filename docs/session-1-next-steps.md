Next Steps after Session 1 - 07/22/2017
=======================================

As you complete each item, be sure to email me about the progress. This way, I can suggest more things to you. Especially the first 2 tasks:

- [ ] Decide which app you want to begin with
- [ ] Create a general design for the application (Pin the design down to only 2-3 pages for simplicity)
- [ ] Go through [this tutorial](./session-1-post-setup.md) to setup your computer for the next steps
- [ ] Finish the `Javascript` Section in the `Udemy` course

When you send me the emails, then I will give you feedback, especially regarding:

- What improvements can be made to the design
- What pieces of the app you can work on first
